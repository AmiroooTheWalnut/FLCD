# FLCD
This repository is related to the paper published as "Facility layout by collision detection and force exertion heuristics".
In order to run the code, create a new Graphical User Interface in Matlab but use "Open existing GUI" and navigate to "FLCD_v5.fig" and open it. Then you are ready to go. If you don't have access to Matlab GUI, simply you can cut the algorithm parts and run out of GUI environment.
Good luck for your researches

Written by Amir Mohammad Esmaieeli Sikaroudi for Matlab GUI. This code is provided for researchers, although it's not suitable for mass running, but the user can cut the parts from this integrated code.
