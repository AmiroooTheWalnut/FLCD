# FLCD
This repository is related to the paper published as "Facility layout by collision detection and force exertion heuristics".
In order to run the code, create a new Graphical User Interface in Matlab but use "Open existing GUI" and navigate to "FLCD_v5.fig" and open it. Then you are ready to go. If you don't have access to Matlab GUI, simply you can cut the algorithm parts and run out of GUI environment.
Good luck for your researches

This code is intended for academic use only, please cite the following paper: "Facility layout by collision detection and force exertion heuristics" https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmsy.2016.07.001 IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE A RELIABLE BENCHMARK FOR THE ALGORITHM, DO NOT USE THE CODE MIXED WITH GUI. PLEASE USE CUT THE PARTS OF THIS CODE.
