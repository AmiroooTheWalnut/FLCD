# FLCD
This repository is related to the paper published as "Facility layout by collision detection and force exertion heuristics".
In order to run the code, create a new Graphical User Interface in Matlab but use "Open existing GUI" and navigate to "FLCD_v5.fig" and open it. Then you are ready to go.
Good luck for your researches
